# Frontal Metrics 


## Overview

This repository contains code for derving frontal metrics from remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (CHL-A) images. 
The goal of this work is to isolate prominent region-specific fronts and develop metrics to quantify their dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales. These metrics are adaptable to different sources and resolution of satellite imagery and should generate a series of products with a range of utility at local and regional scales.
